# Menu-Driven-2

Sorting and Searching Menu-Driven Program

Overview
This C program allows users to perform sorting and searching operations on an array using a menu-driven approach. It includes three sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort) and two searching algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search).

Features
Accepts user input for array size and elements.
Provides a choice to search for an element before sorting.

Implements:
Sorting Algorithms:
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Searching Algorithms:
Linear Search
Binary Search (with automatic sorting before search)
Allows users to display the array at any point.

Menu-driven structure for easy user interaction.
How to Use
Compile the Program
gcc main.c -o program
Run the Program
./program

Follow the on-screen menu:
Enter the number of elements and values.
Choose to perform a search before sorting.
Select a sorting algorithm to sort the array.
Display the sorted array.
Exit the program when done.

Example Execution
Enter the number of elements: 5
Enter 5 elements:
10 5 3 8 2
Do you want to perform a search?
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search (Array must be sorted first)
3. No, show sorting options
Enter your choice: 3
